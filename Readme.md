This will be the longest project and probably the project i put the most effort at
Getsugta tenshu was the move that ichigo used to beat aizen it was his final move with all of his effort on it
thats why i called it Getsuga Tenshuu because i put all my work and efforts in this
to make it the final and best one for some time
